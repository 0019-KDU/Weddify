Here is a proposed **system architecture** for the Wedding Planner Application:  

---

### **1. Microservices Overview**
Each core functionality is implemented as a separate microservice:  

- **Event Management Service**  
- **Guest Management Service**  
- **Vendor Scheduling Service**  
- **Budget Tracking Service**  
- **Task Management Service**  
- **Notification Service**  

Each microservice will have:  
- Its own **database** (SQL/NoSQL) to ensure data independence and scalability.  
- A RESTful API for communication with the API Gateway.  

---

### **2. Communication**
#### **API Gateway**  
- Central entry point for all client requests.  
- Routes requests to appropriate microservices based on endpoints.  

#### **Service Communication**  
- **Synchronous Communication**: REST APIs for real-time data retrieval (e.g., Event Management querying Budget Tracking).  
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for sending notifications or event-driven tasks.  

---

### **3. Databases**  
- **Event Management**: SQL Database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for structured data like event details.  
- **Guest Management**: SQL Database (e.g., MySQL) for guest information and RSVPs.  
- **Vendor Scheduling**: SQL Database for vendor schedules.
- **Budget Tracking**: NoSQL Database (e.g., MongoDB) for flexible budget and expense records.  
- **Task Management**: SQL Database  for task details and status.
- **Notification Service**: SQL Database (e.g., SQLite) for storing notification logs and preferences.

### **4. Architecture Diagram**
Below is a textual representation of the architecture:

```
                          +------------------+
                          |  Client (Web/Mobile App) |
                          +------------------+
                                   |
                                   v
                          +------------------+
                          |    API Gateway    |
                          +------------------+
                                   |
         ---------------------------------------------------
        |                 |                |               |
        v                 v                v               v
+----------------+  +---------------+ +---------------+ +-----------------+
| Event Mgmt     |  | Guest Mgmt    | | Vendor Sched  | | Budget Tracking |
| Service        |  | Service       | | Service       | | Service         |
+----------------+  +---------------+ +---------------+ +-----------------+
      |                    |                 |                   |
+-------------+    +-------------+   +-------------+   +------------------+
| Postgres DB |    | MySQL DB    |   |    DB       |   |         DB       |
+-------------+    +-------------+   +-------------+   +------------------+
         |
         |
---------------------------------------------------
        |                 |               |
        v                 v               v
+----------------+  +----------------+ +----------------+
| Task Mgmt      |  | Notification   | | Other Services |
| Service        |  | Service        | | (if needed)    |
+----------------+  +----------------+ +----------------+
      |                    |
+-------------+      +------------+
| Firestore DB|      | SQLite DB  |
+-------------+      +------------+

```

### **5. Key Features of the Architecture**
- **Decoupled Services**: Each service is independent and modular for easy maintenance.  
- **Scalability**: Microservices can scale independently based on demand (e.g., Notification Service can scale for high traffic).  
- **Security**: API Gateway handles authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.  
- **Resilience**: Message queues enable fault tolerance for asynchronous tasks.
